*Small-malware(Encryption and Decryption Tool)*
=====================================

This repository contains two Python scripts, encryptify.py and datasavior.py, designed to encrypt and decrypt files in a folder.

*About the Scripts*
--------------------

### encryptify.py

encryptify.py is a Python script that encrypts all files present in a specified folder. When run, it generates an encryption key and saves it to a file named thekey.key. This key is essential for decrypting the encrypted files.

### datasavior.py

datasavior.py is a Python script that decrypts the files encrypted by encryptify.py. It takes the encryption key generated by encryptify.py and uses it to restore the original files.

*Usage*
---------

### Step 1: Install Requirements

Before running the scripts, make sure to install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 2: Encrypt Files

Run encryptify.py to encrypt all files in the specified folder:

python encryptify.py

This will generate an encryption key and save it to thekey.key.

### Step 3: Decrypt Files

Run datasavior.py to decrypt the encrypted files using the generated key:

python datasavior.py

Make sure to have the thekey.key file in the same directory as datasavior.py.

*Note*: Make sure to keep the thekey.key file secure, as it is the only way to decrypt the encrypted files.
